## Introduction

Humanoid robots have a unique set of challenges when it comes to movement. Unlike wheeled robots, they must maintain balance while navigating complex environments. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive framework for trajectory optimization that addresses these challenges. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we can enable humanoid robots to execute complex tasks with efficiency and stability.

## Features

- **Trajectory Planning**: Generate smooth and feasible trajectories for humanoid robots.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Implement various optimization techniques tailored for humanoid motion.
- **Simulation Support**: Test and visualize trajectories in simulated environments.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend and modify the framework for specific applications.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you get started.

## Installation

To get started with the Humanoid Trajectory Optimization Playground, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FreeTasteBaby/humanoid-trajopt-playground.git
   cd humanoid-trajopt-playground
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Releases**:

   For the latest features and improvements, download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/FreeTasteBaby/humanoid-trajopt-playground/releases). Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the files properly.

## Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can start using it to optimize trajectories for humanoid robots. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

1. **Import the Library**:

   ```python
   from trajopt import TrajectoryOptimizer
   ```

2. **Create an Optimizer Instance**:

   ```python
   optimizer = TrajectoryOptimizer()
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**:

   Configure your environment settings, including robot parameters and constraints.

4. **Optimize the Trajectory**:

   Call the optimization method to generate a trajectory:

   ```python
   optimized_trajectory = optimizer.optimize(initial_conditions)
   ```

5. **Visualize the Results**:

   Use built-in visualization tools to see how your humanoid robot will move along the optimized path.

## Examples

To help you understand how to use the framework, we have included several examples in the `examples` directory. Each example demonstrates a specific aspect of trajectory optimization. Here are a few highlights:

### Example 1: Basic Trajectory Optimization

This example shows how to optimize a simple trajectory for a humanoid robot navigating through a straight path.

### Example 2: Complex Maneuvers

Explore how to handle complex maneuvers such as turning and jumping. This example illustrates the challenges of maintaining balance during these actions.

### Example 3: Real-time Optimization

Learn how to implement real-time trajectory optimization to adapt to dynamic environments. This example uses sensors to adjust the robot's path on the fly.
